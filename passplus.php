        Pass Plus is an established training course aimed at new drivers and was designed by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA)
        with the help of insurers and the driving instruction industry.<br />
        Statistics show that new drivers are more likely to have an accident in the first two years 
        after passing their test, due to lack of driving experience. Pass Plus is not a driving test 
        but a 6 hour course (minimum) that will build on your current skills and knowledge. It will 
        teach you how to anticipate, plan for and deal with all kinds of hazards, 
        and help you become a more confident driver.
        </p>
        <p> 
        A Pass Plus course can be taken at any time, but it’s ideally taken in the first year after passing your driving test.
        </p>
        <p>
        Pass Plus consists of six modules about driving in different conditions:
