            <h3>MOTORWAY  £42</h3>

            <p>Whether we like it or not, most of us at some point in our lives will find ourselves using motorways on a regular basis. Motorways are an entirely different environment from where we learn to drive, so at first motorway driving can seem quite daunting, and to some even frightening. This is why I strongly recommend that after passing your test you take up some motorway lessons.</p>

             <p>To take a motorway course you must already hold a valid full UK driving licence.</p>
             <p>There is a set fee of £42 per 2 hour session</p>
             <p>All aspects of motorway driving are undertaken.</p>
             <p>Ideal for pupils who are nervous of motorway driving or for those who just want to enhance their all round driving</p>
