                Show me / explain how you would check that the power assisted steering is working before starting a journey.
                </p>
                <span class="fa fa-chevron-down chevron-down"></span>
                <p class="answer">
                If the steering becomes heavy the system may not be working properly. Before starting a journey 
                two simple checks can be made. Gentle pressure on the steering wheel, maintained while the engine 
                is started, should result in a slight but noticeable movement as the system begins to operate. 
                Alternatively turning the steering wheel just after moving off will give an immediate indication 
                that the power assistance is functioning.
